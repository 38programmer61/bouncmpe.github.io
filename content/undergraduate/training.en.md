## Objective

The main objective of In-Service Training is to contribute to the education of
the students of the Faculty of Engineering by providing them practical,
technological, as well as managerial experience and knowledge in nonacademic
organizations.

## Regulations

1. Each student must complete a total of **at least 60 working days** of
   training as a partial requirement for an undergraduate degree in engineering.
2. Each department determines the areas and minimum durations of training
   according to its own engineering formation and educational program, and
   announces them to the students. The duration of each training cannot be less
   than 15 working days, and the total requirement should be completed in **at
   least two different organizations**.
3. It is the responsibility of the department’s training coordinator to
   coordinate and guide training activities in conformity with these bylaws.
4. Students who have successfully completed their undergraduate program, but
   have not fulfilled their training requirements properly are not allowed to
   register. These students have to complete their training by the end of the
   first semester after they complete their coursework in the undergraduate
   program.
5. At the end of each training, the documents listed below must be submitted to
   the training coordinator within one month after the beginning of the next
   academic semester. The total delay in days in the submission of these
   documents after the deadline will be subtracted from the duration of
   training.

## Required Documents

1. **Training Booklet**: This refers to either a specially formatted booklet
   containing several issues related to training and available from the
   University Bookstore and from
   [the Faculty website](https://www.eng.boun.edu.tr), or to a report the format
   of which is determined by the department. This booklet is to be filled in by
   the students in English and it consists mainly of the following three parts:

   - Diary: Containing a brief description of the day-to-day work carried out
   - General Report: Combining the theoretical and practical aspects of the work
     place and the work done.
   - Letter of Evaluation: A letter on the contribution of the training program
     to the student’s education and the suitability of the work place for
     training. This should be a very brief letter written on a separate sheet of
     paper.

2. **Training Certificate**: This is a form where the supervisor of the student
   at the work place evaluates the trainee. This form must be signed by the
   supervisor and handed to the student in a closed and stamped envelope.

## Other Department Rules

1. Industrial training is made in at least two parts in different firms or
   institutions, each of them with at least 15 working days of duration.
1. For each industrial training, the student prepares a training booklet
   explaining the training that she made. The training booklet is filled
   according to its format. The student submits the training booklet to the
   Department at the beginning of the second month of the semester following her
   training period, at the latest. One day is cut off from the training time for
   each late day of submission. Training diaries submitted after the beginning
   of the third month of the semester are not accepted by the Department.
1. The trainee also has to see to it that the training certificate to be filled
   by the manager in the training location reaches the Department in a closed
   envelope. The training is not considered unless the certificate reaches the
   Department until the beginning of the second month of the following semester,
   at the latest.
1. The trainee also submits a letter of evaluation (a few pages) in which she
   evaluates the training she has made together with the training booklet. If
   the training booklet and letter of evaluation are submitted on separate
   dates, the later date is considered to be the submission date.

   format and completeness of the training booklet, the submission dates of the
   booklet, certificate and letter of evaluation, the adequacy of the training
   and whether it has been documented well or not.

   it must also contain the development of a system or application. The
