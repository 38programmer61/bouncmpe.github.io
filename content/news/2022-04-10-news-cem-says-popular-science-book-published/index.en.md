Cem Say's third popular science book, "En Hakiki Mürşit" ("The Truest Guide")
has been published by Doğan Kitap. The book is the story of science, both as a
way of thinking and as humanity's best invention which led it out of the dark
ages. It covers a wide range of fields from astronomy to artificial intelligence
and includes cautionary tales about anti-science beliefs and attacks on academic
autonomy.
